SMART LUNCHBOX MONITORING SYSTEM
================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
The Smart Lunchbox Monitoring System is an IoT-based solution designed to monitor and analyze food consumption patterns of children. The primary objective is to detect whether the child is eating their own food or sharing it with others, while also monitoring food safety parameters. This system provides parents with real-time insights into their child's eating habits and ensures food safety through environmental monitoring.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
-----------------
1. Detect and report unauthorized food sharing
2. Monitor individual food consumption patterns
3. Alert parents/guardians in case of sharing events
4. Track eating schedule and duration
5. Secondary monitoring of food safety parameters

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (IOT LEVEL 5)
---------------------------------
- Multiple sensing nodes for consumption monitoring
- Weight distribution sensors for portion tracking
- Local data processing and pattern recognition
- Cloud-based behavior analysis
- Real-time alerts and notifications
- Mobile/web dashboard for parents/guardians
